# Description

Plugin able to react when one of your camera detect a presence.

---

# Principle

Many cameras offer detection. To perform that detection they can used several ways
* An image analysis based on the amount of pixels change
* A human detection based on the artificial intelligence 
* An audio detection over a configurable threshold

In your camera configuration panel, you can choose how it reacts when a detection is triggered.
1) Take one/several snapshot(s) (with a delay) or create a video for a time lapse.
2) Which process is done with your picture/video. Generally you have the following options
    - Store on the SD Card
    - Send by email
    - Send by FTP
    - **But you never have "Alert" Jeedom** 
        - ![Pleure](../images/cry-32.png)

This plugin allows you to trigger a Jeedom scenario each time there is a camera detection.
You can then choose to:
- Trigger an alarm
- Start the camera recording with the [Jeedom camera plugin](https://doc.jeedom.com/en_US/plugins/security/camera)
- Receive a notification with a [capture](https://doc.jeedom.com/en_US/plugins/security/camera/#Save%20and%20send%20capture)
- Close your shutters
- or any Jeedom actions

> ___All the information requested for the plugin stay in your local network, nothing is send on the internet.___

# Jeedom Configuration

Cameras are automatically created at the first detection or when you test the connection in the camera configuration.

If it is not displayed in the plugin equipments, you can click on the **Synchronisation** button to force it. If this action don't show your camera, check your camera settings against the plugin configuration.

After its creation, you can rename your equipment and change its usual Jeedom parameters.

To no overload Jeedom, in case a camera send a lot of alerts, there is a protection with a minimal delay between 2 alerts. With 60 seconds by default, but you can change it at your convenience.
